In this SQL Project for Data Analysis, I'll will efficiently leverage various analytical features and functions accessible through SQL in PostgreSQL

# Moto Of The Project
I have first installed the PostgreSQL database and created a username and password to it. In the next step I have downloaded and installed pgadmin server to manage our PostgreSQL database. Connected both of them by the credentials which we have created intially in the database. 

Performed querying to the data using the query tool.
